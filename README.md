Assembler for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3


## About

`lmsasm` is a tool to compile LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 bytecode language files (*.lms)
into LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 VM executable files (*.rbf).

This particular version is a reimplementation of the `lmsasm` tool that is part
of the [official EV3 Firmware Source Code][lms downloads].

There is also a `lmsgen` tool that can be used to generate code based on the
[bytecode definitions file][ev3.yml].
